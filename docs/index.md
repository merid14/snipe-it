# Snipe-IT Installation Guide

Snipe-IT is a Free Open Source (FOSS) project for IT asset management, to enable IT departments to track who has which laptop, when it was purchased, which software licenses and accessories are available, and so on.

It is built on [Laravel 4.2](http://laravel.com) and uses the [Sentry 2](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry) package.

This project is  actively developed and we [release quite frequently](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/releases). __Check out the [Snipe-IT website](http://www.snipeitapp.com) for a demo, a comprehensive list of features, screenshots and [our blog](http://snipeitapp.com/news/) for updates on new versions.__

__This is web-based software__. This means there there is no executable file (aka no .exe files), and it must be run on a web server and accessed through a web browser. It runs on any flavor of Linux or OSX as well as Windows.
