# Server Configuration

As mentioned, Snipe-IT is web-based software, which means it requires a web server to run.

#### You must complete all of the steps in the installation section, in addition to configuring your server. That means you will [download the software](../downloading.html), [customize your configuration files](../configuration.html), [install the dependencies with composer](../composer.html), and run the [command line utility](../command-line.html), in addition to configuring your web server.

Installation should take around twenty minutes or less, if nothing goes wrong, and if you're pretty familiar with web server configuration.

__NOTE: You should never run Snipe-IT (or any website, ever) as a root (Linux) or Administrator (Windows). Create an unprivileged user and make them the owner of the files.__

We also provide server configuration instructions for [XAMPP](xampp.html), [WAMP](wamp.html) and [Docker](docker.html).

If this all looks too overwhelming for you, we do offer [affordable hosted solutions](http://snipeitapp.com/hosting/) for folks who want to use Snipe-IT but don't know how to run a web server, or don't have time to keep up with updates.
