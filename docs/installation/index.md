# Installation Overview

The installation instructions provided here are for a production installation of Snipe-IT. If you are a developer looking to contribute to Snipe-IT, please see the [Contributing](/contributing.html) page.

Once you have [downloaded Snipe-IT](downloading.html), you'll need to complete all of the steps in the installation section, in addition to configuring your server. That means you will now create an empty MySQL/MariaDB database, [customize your configuration files](configuration.html), [install the dependencies with composer](composer.html), and run the [command line utility](command-line.html), and then configure your web server.

Installation should take around twenty minutes or less, if nothing goes wrong, and if you're pretty familiar with web server configuration.

If this all looks too overwhelming for you, we do offer [affordable hosted solutions](http://snipeitapp.com/hosting/) for folks who want to use Snipe-IT but don't know how to run a web server, or don't have time to keep up with updates.
