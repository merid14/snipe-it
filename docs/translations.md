# Translations!

If you're not a coder but want to give back to the project and you're fluent in other languages, consider helping out with the translations. We use the [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com) localization platform to manage translations, and it makes it super-simple for you to add translations to the project without messing with code. Check out [the Snipe-IT CrowdIn translation project here](https://crowdin.com/project/snipe-it/).

We currently have English, Spanish, German, Korean and Brazilian Portuguese completed, and are looking for more!

If you'd like to translate Snipe-IT into a language that we don't currently offer, simply let us know via the CrowdIn platform or by [creating an issue on Github](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/issues) and we'll get that set up for you.

**Please do not submit pull requests with language files directly to the repository. The CrowdIn platform allows us to make sure all of language files are in sync between versions and releases, so we only accept translations through the CrowdIn platform.**
